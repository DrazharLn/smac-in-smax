These files let you play unalderated Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in the Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire engine. You might want to do this to benefit from various unofficial patches for Alien Crossfire.

There are two folders, thinker and yitzi for use with the unofficial patches with those names.

thinker expects the files in a special `ac_mod` directory. Yitzi expects them to replace the existing files with the same name, so make a backup in that case.

Check the releases for zips for each you can just extract into your SMAC folder.

The original release thread is here: http://alphacentauri2.info/index.php?topic=17869.0

I can't find the original development thread, but it's somewhere else on AC2.
